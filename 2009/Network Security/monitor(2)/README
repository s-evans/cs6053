Create a directory anywhere and put all three subdirectories (Project,
logs, and Final) into it.  The script "runit" may be used to start the
monitor.  Alternatively, the following may be run from the command line
(either windows, mac, or linux) in the parent directory of "Project":

java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -ss1m -ms96m -mx156m MonitorServer 8180 NEW DYNAMIC ../Final >& ../logs/final.log

this assumes the java program is in the executable path of the user.  The
above and the runit script set the monitor listening port to 8180.  This
can be adjusted as desired.  Two other parameters are important.  The first
has the possible values NEW and RECOVER, the second has possible values
DYNAMIC and STATIC.  Parameter NEW is used to start the monitor fresh without
remembering any previous sessions.  Thus, the file Final/players.db is 
completely overwritten by a file representing no players.  The parameter
RECOVER is used to resume a session that had been terminated by killing
the monitor.  All players of the previous session are remembered as well
as all their statistics.  Parameter DYNAMIC means new player identities can
be added to the session via simple login requests.  Parameter STATIC means
no new identities can be added.

The players.db file is updated every three minutes by default but this
can be changed in GameParameters.java.
